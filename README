Building & Running darklaunch:
1) make rel
2) cd rel/darklaunch
3) bin/darklaunch console

Hacking on darklaunch:
1) make devrel(*)
2) Edit code
3) Compile and reload via 'make update'(**)

*The devrel target generates a standard OTP release and then
 symlinks the code for all dependencies and the application
 code into the resulting release tree. This allows a shorter
 edit/compile/debug cycle during development when devrel is
 coupled with 'make update'.

** The update target compiles any changed files and performs
   a warm restart of the Erlang VM. This triggers a global
   code reload. This is very handy when hacking on the code
   or trying to debug a problem. 'make update' only works when
   a release has been built via 'make devrel'.
